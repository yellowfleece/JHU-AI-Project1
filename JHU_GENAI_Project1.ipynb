        "1. **Accurate Classification**: The AI successfully classified {total_emails} emails into 6 distinct categories with high precision. The system correctly identified {critical_emails} critical emails requiring immediate attention, demonstrating strong business relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Real Business Data Processing**: Using actual business emails from Alex Carter's inbox provided authentic classification scenarios including approval requests, system issues, vendor communications, and project updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Professional Response Generation**: AI-generated email responses maintained proper business structure (salutation, greeting, body, next steps, closing) and appropriate tone for different stakeholder relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The system provided actionable insights for urgent emails with specific timelines and business impact assessments, enabling effective priority management.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Quality Validation**: LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation confirmed the system's outputs meet professional standards for relevance, clarity, and actionability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Context Dependency**: The system relies on email content quality and may struggle with very brief or ambiguous communications that lack clear business context.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Static Classification**: Current categories are fixed; the system cannot adapt to organization-specific priority classifications without prompt modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Limited Historical Context**: Analysis is based on individual emails without considering email thread history or ongoing project context.\n",
