An improvement would be an expanded analysis into e-mail metadata such as time patterns, attachment types, and thread length.  Mapping a sender relationship would also create more sophistication to the solution. These variables would better differentiate through routine e-mails and prioritization.\n",

        "*  The system as developed operates using pre-determined and static rules that will not evolve in a sustained real world use case.  Implementing a feedback mechanism would allow the system to learn from miscategorized e-mails when an operator provides such feedback.  Over time the solution would improve accurancy and reduce manual reviews by the intended operator.\n"
